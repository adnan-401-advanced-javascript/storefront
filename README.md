### Phases

1. `Phase1`
Create a visually appealing site using Material UI <br/>
Use a Redux Store to manage the state of categories and items in the store
Display a list of categories from state <br/>
When the user selects (clicks on) a category … <br/>
    Identify that category as selected (change of class/display) <br/>
    Show a list of products associated with the category <br/>
